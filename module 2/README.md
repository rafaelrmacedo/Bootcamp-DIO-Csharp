# Second Module finished âœ…

# What I learned?
- This module was very important to review the basics about programming. 
  - In the first course I reviewed the basics as I had said above. I reviewed arrays, variables, matrix, if statements, etc. 
  - The second course was an introduction to Git and GitHub, which in my case, I just used it to review some commands I had forgotten about. Nothing was a surprise in this module, without belittling, of course.
  - And in the third course was for creating our first repository, to store our projects, such as the final projects of each module.
